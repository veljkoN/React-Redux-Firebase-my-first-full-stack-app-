## About
This is my first full stack application created with **React** as front end and **firebase (firestore)** services as back end. I also used redux with thunk middleware. Signup and Signin logic use Firebase Authentication service. Data created in the application store in Cloud Firestore and all created items trigger Cloud Firestore functions (on create a user account, and  on create, delete and change item). Using redux all information about data is reached from redux store. I implemented Bootstrap 4 to give application responsible design.
